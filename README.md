# BENIN_REDISTRICTING
Algorithmic redistricting of Benin using graph theory and community detection.


This project applies Graph Theory and Community Dectection Algorithm to perform
algorithmic redistricting of my citizenship country Benin Republic.
Features
- Uses **GeoPandas** to read Benin ADM3 boundaries.
- Builds an **adjacency graph** where each node is a commune.
- Applies **greedy modularity community detection** to group communes into districts.
- Visualizes results on a real map with **matplotlib**.
